#### model ollama_chat/qwen2.5-coder:32b  
> Initial repo scan can be slow in larger repos, but only happens once.  

To update the model to `ollama_chat/qwen2.5-coder:32b`, the files most likely to need changes are:

1. `apps/chat-tools/src/app/llm/ollama.state.ts` - This file likely contains the model configuration.
2. `apps/lg-cli/src/examples/basic.ts` - This file might have model-specific examples or configurations.
3. `apps/lg-cli/src/examples/reasoning.ts` - This file might also have model-specific configurations.

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.
